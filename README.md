# Vibes

Curated wallpapers, picked by Cassidy

## Design

The goal for this is to be an app, some day. :) The original descriptions that I came up with that inspired this app were:

>**~~Backdrop~~ Vibes**: Small collection of curated wallpapers. Maybe using an Unsplash collection as a back-end, or just shipping the wallpapers with the app.

>Curated wallpapers, mostly picked from Unsplash‚Ä¶ In short, I pick wallpapers from Unsplash that I could see being shipped by default with elementary OS. My personal guidelines mostly echo the unofficial guidelines of elementary.

Since those were wrote 5‚Äì10 years ago, the current parameters are:

1. GNOME-focused (GTK, Adwaita) Flatpak app distributed via Flathub
2. Contains a collection of light/dark-style wallpapers that work in GNOME (and elementary OS)
3. Maybe contains other wallpaper categories, like the elementary-ish ones mentioned above

Roughly, I see the app working like:

1. Show a grid of wallpapers; if they support light/dark style, preview them halvsies similar to GNOME
2. Selecting a wallpaper throws the FreeDesktop portal to set it
3. Maybe have an ‚ÄúInstall All‚Äù option to get them to all show up in Settings?
4. Eventually, maybe a sidebar with categories ü§∑
