Curated wallpapers picked from Unsplash

## How I Curate

In short, I pick wallpapers from Unsplash that I could see being shipped by default with [elementary OS](https://elementary.io). My personal guidelines mostly echo the unofficial guidelines of elementary. Here they are in order I consider them (from most to least important):

### 0. Photography Only

Unsplash only hosts photos (no digital art), but that's not the original reason for this guideline. I prefer photos because the rest of the computer is so digital (with the UI and icons being fairly sterile). A photographic wallpaper does a great job of countering that with something from real, physical life.

### 1. No People

I love humans, but putting them in wallpapers causes unnecessary difficulties. Race, gender, and culture all play into an image, and not every image of a human would be appropriate or well-received in all cultural contexts. It's easiest to avoid 'em.

### 2. Strong Focal Point

Typically, I favor wallpapers with a single, strong, central focal point. Tilt shift is welcome, but not required. The reasoning for this (aside from purely aesthetic preferences) is that operating systems like elementary OS and Android have translucent or semi-translucent UI elements at the top and bottom of the wallpaper, so sharpness there is distracting.

This also creates a nice effect when windows are open above the wallpaper as they typically cover the focal point, making the rest of the wallpaper feel like it's literally out of focus in the background.

### 3. Avoid Words & Symbols

Similar to 1, avoiding words and symbols avoids the potential for culture clash or at least the inability to understand from different cultures. This guideline can be bent when the word or symbol does not have a significant affect on the mood of the wallpaper, but it's still best to avoid them.

### 4. Prefer Nature

This may just be a side effect of the former points, but generally I prefer photos of nature. Human-made objects can be interesting (and some do make great wallpapers), but plants and landscapes are more universal and less biased from a cultural perspective.

### 5. Cool, Slightly Muted Colors

This is probably due to the aesthetics of elementary OS itself, but I tend to prefer photos with cooler, slightly muted colors. Strong contrast can distract, and warm colors don't always fit well.
